## 🚩 Problem Statement

The two-wheeler industry in India is vast and competitive, with multiple manufacturers, models, and fuel types dominating various market segments. However, deriving meaningful insights from sales, resale, and performance data can be challenging due to fragmented information and lack of visual representation.


## 🛠️ Steps Involved in Building the Dashboard

- Sourced bike sales and resale data for major manufacturers (e.g., Bajaj, Hero, Honda, KTM, Yamaha, etc.).

- Included variables such as brand, model, year of manufacture, fuel type, mileage, price, resale price, city tier, and ownership type.

## 2. Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)

- Handled missing values and nulls.

- Renamed columns for consistency.

- Converted data types where necessary.

## 3. Visual Design (Report View)

- Used slicers for: Year of Manufacture, Brand, Fuel Type
## 4. Visualizations Used
